This package is used to generate and manage OTP's for users, it can be used to generate OTP's for any model you want.

## What makes this package different from other OTP packages?
The special feature of this package is that the OTP generated by extending  google2fa, this means that the OTP generated by this package can be used with any authenticator app.
- You can use any authenticator app to scan the QR code generated by this package and use it to validate OTP's for your users, the same way you use google2fa you can use this package.
- Since we can generate the OTP's for any model you want, you can send the OTP generated by SMS or Email to your users. and they can use it to validate their accounts.
- This is very handy if you want to use OTP's for your users but you don't want to use the authenticator app. Or give your users the option to use authenticator or receive the OTP in sms.
- Authenticator OTP's expire in half a minute, but the OTP's generated by this package expire in any specified number of  minutes, You can have a valid OTP for the last five minutes.
- If you use the authenticator to authenticate the QR code generated by this package, you can use the same QR code to authenticate the OTP's generated by this package.
- If You revcive by Email or Sms, it natuarly takes longer than half a minute to receive the OTP, so you can use the same received code to authenticate the OTP's generated by this package, since it is valid for the specified minutes.
